# Compilers

This is a compiler for a custom programming language named Cimple.

It is a semester project for the course CSE/MYY802 - Compilers of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UoI.

# Front - End

The front end part analyzes the source code with lectical, syntax and sematic analyzer, in order to generate an internal
represantation of the program, called the intermediate code.

# Back - End

The back end is responsible for generating machine level code (assembly code) so the CPU can execute it. 
In particular the generated code is for the MIPS processor.
